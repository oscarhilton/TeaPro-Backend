The tea is pale green in colour and has a fresh aroma.\nNormally, only the top few leaves from each shoot are used since they are the richest in flavour. Once proessed, Sencha has small, almost powdery particles, or long, delicate, slender stands.\n\nWhen made with boiling water or near-boiling water, it can be very astringent, bitter and harsh, but when prepared with water around 75C° and infused for up to 45 sec, Sencha green tea tastes smoother, sweeter and more balanced. Increase the steeping time for each re-brew.",

It is steamed to stop oxidation before it starts, which preserves most of the polyphenols. It has 60% more polyphenol (antioxidants) content than black tea, and has a less bitter taste.\n\nPolyphenols can help the body protect itself against free radicals; molecules, which occur in the environment and are naturally produced by the body, and can cause damage to cells. Chronic damage by free radicals is one factor thought to contribute to the development of many chronic diseases including heart disease or cancer. Polyphenols scavenge cell-damaging free radicals, which are linked with cancer-causing genes and cause LDL cholesterol to form artery-clogging plaque. The polyphenols in tea possess 25 to 100 times the antioxidant potency of vitamins C and E. Antioxidants impair the ability of free radical cells to harm the molecules that make up our bodies.",

In Norway the plant was cultivated in special gardens and it was probably the first medicinal plant that was exported from the Nordic countries to the rest of Europe.\n The flowers are yellow with a hint of green and blossom from July to August.
